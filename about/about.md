Hello, there! üëãüèª

My name is **Borja**, and I grew up surrounded by computers. The first OS I used was MS-DOS as kid, in a really old Olivetti M380 XP3 80386. I loved since the very beggining changing batch and system files, just to see _what would happen if I change this thing I don't event understand_. Those were fun times for my father.

Eventually I fell in love with operating systems and opensource development.

Nowadays, my key expertise areas are Red Hat OpenShift, Kubernetes, programming and automation & CI/CD. And I still love kernel and networking problems, as debugging complex low-level stuff is my main passion.

My current role is **Principal Software Engineer**@**Red Hat**, where I'm mainly focused in the architecture and developing of software pieces focused in OpenShift, Kubernetes, container runtimes, bugfixing and contributing in whatever project I stumble upon.

I guess I just perform some software engineer stuff.
