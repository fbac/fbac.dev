### **`[fbac@localhost ~]$ cat about.md`**

Hello, there! :wave:

My name is **Borja**, and I grew up surrounded by computers. Eventually I fell in love with development and opensource development.

My key expertise areas are Red Hat OpenShift, Kubernetes, software development and automation & CI/CD, and I love kernel and networking problems, as debugging complex low-level stuff is one of my passions.

My current role is **Principal Software Engineer**@**Red Hat**, where I'm mainly focused in the architecture and developing of pieces of software, focused in OpenShift, Kubernetes, container runtimes, bugfixing and contributing in whatever project I stumble upon.

... I guess I just perform some software engineer stuff.
